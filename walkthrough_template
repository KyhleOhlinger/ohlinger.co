## Information Gathering

In order to start the VM, I started with the Information gathering phase. Let's begin with a Nmap Scan.

### Nmap Output

<details>

```bat

```

</details>


From the output shown above, we can see that the machine is a Linux machine and I added `doctor.htb` to the `/etc/hosts` file. As this is a Linux machine and it only has 3 open ports, I started by doing some web enumeration. 

### Basic Web Enumeration
While browsing the web application, I ran the following scans:
* Gobuster
* Ffuf
* Wfuzz
* Nikto

The output of the scans is shown below:

```bat
