This is the personal blog and website of Kyhle Ã–hlinger. I post a few different sorts of things here. My day job is in cyber security, and involves a lot of tinkering with random technologies, which I do plenty of outside of work as well.  I also write general posts about subjects I find interesting, usually related to mental wellbeing, programming and tech.
