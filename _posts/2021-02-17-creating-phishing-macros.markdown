Test your phishing campaigns before sending!!!


Sandboxes run Macros without prompting right? What if you wrote your Macro to check that it’s set to run without prompting and don’t run? :) only run if it’s on enable content setting... which is more likely to be observed in a real environment.

Remove all document information when creating your Macros. You can even edit the file to put in false attribution data.
