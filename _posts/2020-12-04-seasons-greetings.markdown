Hi everyone,

I would like to wish you the best for the holiday season! 

2020 has definitely had its ups and downs -- I will definitely be doing a year in review at the start of next year but as a quick recap, this year was the start of this blog and I'm really happy that I have helped at least a handful of people. Additionally, I recently created the walkthrough section which has been quite a bit of work, but I have learnt a tremendous amount in the process.

This will be the last post of this year since I need to take some well deserved time off, but I will continue to upload a new HackTheBox walkthrough every week during the holiday season. If you have been keeping up to date with my posts and walkthroughs, I really do hope that you have learnt something along the way. A number of you have reached out to me so far, but for anyone that has not and would like to, please feel free to send me an email or any other form of message and I will get back to you as soon as I can. 

If you have not read my blog post on [Creating a Challenge VM](https://ohlinger.co/creating-a-challenge-vm/), it included some really cool holiday season hacking events. Since it is almost Christmas time, [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/christmas) have released their advent calendar of Christmas challenges which are really fun and have a ton of hints if you get stuck. Additionally, [SANS Kringlecon](https://holidayhackchallenge.com/2020/) challenges will be released towards the middle of the month and you can stay up to date with their festive season event on their [Kringlecon Twitter](https://twitter.com/KringleCon) page. If you are bored and are looking to have some fun hacking your way through this holiday period, I highly recommend those events!

I have plenty of exciting new posts as well as a blog rework lined up for 2021 that I cannot wait to show you. Until then, eat well, rest up and have a wonderful festive season.

See you in 2021!
