* Does not include budgeting or savings advice
* Should look at putting away about 10% of your income and you will be pretty well off

### For F-Secure, Why am I Writing this?

The majority of the workforce is pretty young and earn a decent amount of money every month. With that being said, I'm not convinced that everyone knows what to do with their money. Savings accounts are great, you most likely have an RA, and you might be saving which are all worthwhile things but how can you ensure that you are able to live comfortably in the future? My hope is that this will get you to think just a little about your financial wellbeing, even if you only start looking at investing in a few years time. There is no wrong time to start, but the earlier you begin, the more assets you will be able to acquire throughout your life.


*Disclaimer: This is not financial advise, this is my personal opinion on areas that I believe everyone should have a basic understanding of in order to be financially stable.*

Financial Literacy -- something

Financial intelligence is -- at a very high-level -- understanding a financial situation, and in this post I'm specifically going to be focusing on personal finances regarding investments and what I believe every person should know in order to gain a basic understanding of finance in a business world. I'm not a financial advisor so you can take these concepts with a pinch or salt, but my intention is to enlighten everyone on what seem to be very complicated topics. There are some fantastic websites with a ton of information on these topics if you're interested: <https://www.investopedia.com/>. 

### Why Should you Read this? 
Intelligence about a topic is what solves problems, not (in this case) money. When you increase your knowledge about about a topic, it is possible that your (in this case) money will also increase. It is about understanding money, understanding investing, and understanding the right questions to ask even if you intend to have other people manage your finances for you. 

The main concepts that I am going to be covering are:
- **Types of Assets:** What are Assets? 
- **Financial Portfolio:** What is a Financial Portfolio?
- **Areas of Knowledge:** Fundamental Building Blocks

## What Are Assets?

Before we start looking into investments and investment strategies, you need to understand what assets are. 

## What is a Financial Portfolio?

A financial portfolio is a collection of:
* Stocks
* Bonds
* Commodities
* Real-Estate
* Cash & Cash Equivalents

The investments themselves can be managed by you or a financial advisor, but the key to any financial portfolio is:
> Don't put all of your eggs in one basket.

What this boils down to is that diversification is key. This ensures that if one area, e.g. Real-Estate, crashes, your entire portfolio won't take a hit and you will still be able to make money with your other assets until the area bounces back. In financial terms: "Investors aim to construct a well-diversified portfolio to achieve a risk-return portfolio allocation relevant to your risk tolerance". 

Risk-Tolerance in this instance is exactly how it sounds, how open are you to taking risks? This will be determined by your objectives, liquidity needs, and timelines. For example, if you are looking for a high-risk, high-reward investment, then Crypto such as Dogecoin could be an idea, however if you're looking for a "guaranteed" investment with almost "guaranteed returns", bonds would probably be a safer bet.

There are several types of portfolios that someone can invest in and I have provided a basic definition of each below:
* Aggressive, Equity-Focused Portfolio: This is a great-risk, great-reward portfolio focusing on buying stocks in companies which are basically startups with good value propositions.
* Defensive, Equity-Focused Portfolio: This is a consumer staple portfolio which focuses on buying stocks that are known to to well in good & bad times.
* Income-Focused, Equities Portfolio: This focuses on shareholders returns.
* Speculative, Equity-Focused Portfolio: This is for investors with a high-risk tolerance and is akin to gambling.
* Hybrid Portfolio: This diversifies your assets across various classes.

You can have several portfolios, each with a different amount and risk-level but you need to ensure that you aren't losing money. Also, the breakdowns are meant to provide you with information so that if you do use a financial advisor, you at least have an understanding of the terminology and the risk associated with different types of investments. If you would like to manage your own money, it will require significant effort and it should only be done if you are willing to spend time researching different concepts and investments.

## Fundamental Building Blocks 

Now that you have a very high-level breakdown of what a financial portfolio is, these are the sections that I believe you should spend some time learning about if you do intend on managing your own finance:
* Accounting
* Investing
* Understanding Markets
* The Law

If you understand that, you have a great foundation from which to build your assets.
