Hi Everyone, 

During the past few weeks I've been working on creating a new section as part of my blog -- [Walkthroughs](https://ohlinger.co/walkthroughs). The purpose of this section is to run through Challenge VMs, provide useful information about how I attempt to solve these VMs and also force myself to continue learning new things along the way. Image below shows layout of the walkthrough section:

* **Challenge VM Basics:** This section includes a link to my base pentesting VM, the basic layout I use for each challenge VM, and the basic methodology that I follow.
* **Key Takeaways:** This section provides a table containing the main learnings from each challenge VM as a quick reference guide for whoever is interested.
* **Walkthroughs:** Each walkthrough will have it's own section detailing how I completed the machine -- Initially this will be limited to [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.eu/).


*Quick note on walkthrough releases* -- Each writeup will be available once the machine is retired from active rotation as per the regulations set out by HackTheBox, but you are more than welcome to reach out to me with questions about any machine that is on the list. I hope that you find the section useful! If you have any comments about the walkthroughs or any suggestions about what you would like me to cover, please let me know :)
