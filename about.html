        This is the personal blog and website of Kyhle Öhlinger. I post a few different things here. My day job is in cyber security, and involves a lot of tinkering with random technologies, which I do plenty of outside of work as well.  I also write general posts about subjects I find interesting, usually related to mental wellbeing, programming and tech.

        I enjoy sports, martial arts and keeping up to date with science and technology. In my free time I also enjoy reading, cooking and solving brain teasers. Most recently I have made an active effort to read a variety of business focused books in order to increase my business and customer relations knowledge. In order to keep up to date with the field of cyber security, I make an active effort to attend security conferences and meetups, including 0xC0FFEE JHB, OWASP JHB, BSides Cape Town and most recently, Defcon 27.

        <h2> Blog Posts </h2>
        <p>
        My blog posts can be found on the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/">main page</a> or a listing per category is provided <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/tags/">here</a>. I've tried to add the correct tags to each of the posts so that they can easily be identified by their categories. I will also be adding in a more visual approach to identifiying the blog posts in the coming weeks.
