        My name is Kyhle Öhlinger and this is my personal blog. Although my day job is in cyber security which requires that I constantly keep up to date with various technologies, I enjoy playing around with random technologies outside of work as well.  I tend to write posts about subjects I find interesting, usually related to mental wellbeing, my take on the industry and technical writeups related to what I'm looking at.

        I enjoy sports, martial arts and keeping up to date with science and technology. In my free time I also enjoy reading, cooking and solving brain teasers. In general, I end up reading multiple books at the same time &#x2012; on average I swap between 1-3 books at any given point. Most recently I have made an active effort to read a variety of business focused books in order to increase my knowledge of a field that I am intrigued by. In order to keep up to date with the field of cyber security, I make an active effort to attend security conferences and meetups, including; 0xC0FFEE JHB, OWASP JHB, BSides Cape Town and most recently, Defcon 27.
